### Description



The Advanced Data Journalism course teaches students the next level of skills and reporting to succeed as data journalists. The course builds on what you learned in Data Journalism, but goes deeper into hands on data gathering, cleaning, data mining, data analysis and data visualization for storytelling. We will be working intensively with Python (one of the popular programming language in newsrooms that is well-leveraged or suited for working with data).

The course will focus on one class big reporting project (with students working in small teams). We have two themes for this course: 1) Politics, power and money in New York, and 2) Economics, race and gender. The City of New York has a an annual budget close to $85 billion dollars - the largest of any city in the world. This involves thousands of contracts, vendors, services, projects, companies and lobbyist targeting elected officials (who receive campaign donations), as well as programs related to race and gender. Both themes work as intersectional beats that cross each other and other issues.

We will take on the above mentioned by exploring city datasets and documents (starting from general questions to the most specific) in class lab time exercises; by inviting experts to class; and by doing on-the-ground reporting.

The sessions will be organized around 4 main areas, oriented by journalism questions:


1.  Data cleaning and processing
2.  Data mining
3.  Data analysis
4.  Data visualization

In case you wonder, we won't be using or teaching Excel (you got that already in Data Journalism 1, and you can use it whenever you feel the need to do so, since its complementary to the work in Python). Why? Excel is a great tool to explore, analyze and browse data, as well as to do calculations and clean small sets of data. But it lacks what Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks bring to the table: the ability to keep track of changes, automatize data analysis and other tasks, as well as to save your work as notebooks so your editors and other people can reproduce your work.

When it comes to statistical analysis - that you are already familiar with from the Data Journalism 1 course in the Spring - we will also be using Python with data stored as pandas (numpy, scypi) dataframe objects. This includes statistical data modeling: hypothesis testing, probability distributions, linear and non linear models.

You will publish your stories in a class mobile-friendly website produced by everyone before the end of the semester (we will define roles and responsibilities).


# Assignments

Your grade is made up of three parts. Your two assignments and your in-class work and participation:



*   Story 1: 40 points
*   Story 2:  40 points
*   Class exercises and participation: 20 points


## Requirements for story 1



*   Write a data-driven story.
*   500 – 800 words.
*   Uses one or more datasets and at least 3 human sources that YOU have interviewed. This sources do not necessarily need to be directly referenced in the piece. If he or she is not referenced, you must explain in a note how this source helped you.


## Requirements for story 2



*   A data-driven story that in its final version will be presented in a web page that can include visual or graphic elements that you propose.
*   700 – 1000 words.
*   Uses two or more datasets and at least 6 human sources that YOU have interviewed. This sources do not necessarily need to be directly referenced in the piece. If he or she is not referenced, you must explain in a note how this source helped you.
*   Build a web page for your story


## Details of each story assignment

The reporting assignments for this course are two data journalism stories. For each story you will hand in pitches, reporting memos, drafts and final pieces. You will file your work in your assigned team Drive folder.  

Each story includes the following deliverables:



*   Pitch (5 points)
*   Reporting memo (5 points)
*   Draft (15 points)
*   Story (15 points)


#### Pitch

  A pitch should be 1 page long, 2 pages long max.   including the following things:

    *   Why this story is relevant ("So what?) and why now?
    *   What is the single question your story tries to answer?
    *   Why will this story resonate with your audience?
    *   What else has been done on this topic? (Provide links) and how is your angle different or fresh?    
*   List in bullets the unique findings your story will reveal
*   Maximum/minimum.
    *   What is the maximum (best) story possible?
    *   What's the minimum (fallback) story if your hypothesis doesn't prove out?


#### Reporting memo

## Course Rules  


* **Students-Instructors contract.** The success of this course depends on the level of commitment of each student. That is, it is up to each student to carry out their class work and assignments as well as to contribute to their team’s reporting and speak up about any doubts or concerns you may have. In return, the instructors will do their best to provide a clear lesson plan, give students timely feedback and advice them to achieve the course expected outcomes.

* **Team-work** Make sure to establish clear team goals, responsibilities and agree on how to measure your team progress and what to do if a team member is not pulling his/her weight. The grade will be a group one, so being able to work with others and manage your time out of class will be critical for your success.

* **Attendance and punctuality.** We meet 15 times during the spring semester. You must attend every class and be on time. If you’re sick or you have an emergency, let us know via Slack. If you don’t show up, you will hear from us. More than one unexcused absence will penalize your overall grade by 5%. Similarly, two tardiness equals an absence.

* **Deadlines matter.** This is of vital importance, not only for the class but also in the professional career of any journalist, because deadlines are sacred. Please carefully note these rule: there will be a 5 percent deduction of your assignment grade for every 24 hours that passes after a deadline in which you have not turned it in. The only exceptions are medical emergency or family emergency. Make-up work will not be offered except in extenuating circumstances.

* **Communicate.** If you have a problem or if you have difficulties, tell us right away, not after is too late. In journalism that’s what we do. When we have a problem we immediately tell our editor.

* **Be accurate and use language correctly.** The value of journalistic work depends on credibility. That is why assignments must have a rigorous verification of the data and information presented. That is the basis of the profession. A story with erroneous information can carry out an F grade. We expect the language to be used correctly. Follow the AP Style guidelines. Aim for clarity, precision and correct spelling and grammar.

* **Be a pro.** Honesty, courtesy, curiosity and professionalism are the core values of a journalist. Behave like one because you are a journalist. When classmates are presenting or we have guests or we are working in teams don’t multitask, focus.

* **Participation.** It is important to maintain an attitude of openness. Class time is reserved for learning and discussing the topics of each session. It is not the time for personal calls, text messages, emails and social networks.

* **Diversity and inclusion.** It's critical that you learn to include a diverse set of voices in their stories, something that is often glossed over when finding stories in spreadsheets and online sources. You are encouraged and expected to look for stories about and voices from communities that are underrepresented. This also applies to our classroom. It requires us all to discuss differences with respect and empathy, regarding race, gender, age, religion, sexual preference, disability, language, origin or political beliefs.

* **Code of honor.** This class follows the guidelines of the Student Handbook of our school. More so, in journalism plagiarism or falsification of data, sources and facts are serious crimes that can lead to failing this class. You may also be the subject of suspension, probation or expulsion, pending the decision of the School administration.

Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.

Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.

If you're repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you're not sure how to credit code, ask.

The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the [Citizen Media Law Project](http://www.dmlp.org/) is an excellent resource.

When in doubt: ask.
