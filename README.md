### Description



The Advanced Data Journalism course teaches students the next level of skills and reporting to succeed as data journalists. The course builds on what you learned in Data Journalism, but goes deeper into hands on data gathering, cleaning, data mining, data analysis and data visualization for storytelling. We will be working intensively with Python (one of the popular programming language in newsrooms that is well-leveraged or suited for working with data). We will also use Javascript visualization libraries for mapping and graphics.

The course will focus on one class big reporting project (with students working in small reporting teams). We have two themes for this course: 1) Politics, Power and Money in New York, and 2) Economics, race and gender. The City of New York has a an annual budget close to $85 billion dollars - the largest of any city in the world. This involves thousands of contracts, vendors, services, projects, companies and lobbyist targeting elected officials (who receive campaign donations), as well as programs related to race and gender. Both themes work as intersectional beats that cross each other and other issues.

We will take on the above mentioned by exploring city datasets and documents (starting from general questions to the most specific) in class lab time exercises; by inviting experts to class; and by doing on-the-ground reporting.

The sessions will be organized around 4 main areas, oriented by journalism questions:



1.  Data cleaning and processing
1.  Data mining
1.  Data analysis
1.  Data visualization

In case you wonder, we won't be using or teaching Excel (you got that already in Data Journalism 1, and you can use it whenever you feel the need to do so, since its complementary to the work in Python). Why? Excel is a great tool to explore, analyze and browse data, as well as to do calculations and clean small sets of data. But it lacks what Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks bring to the table: the ability to keep track of changes, automatize data analysis and other tasks, as well as to save your work as notebooks so your editors and other people can reproduce your work.

When it comes to statistical analysis - that you are already familiar with from the Data Journalism 1 course in the Spring - we will also be using Python with data stored as pandas (numpy, scypi) dataframe objects. This includes statistical data modeling: hypothesis testing, probability distributions, linear and non linear models.

### Key skills, work, deliverables

You will learn to:



*   Do in depth data and statistical analysis with Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks (Probability distribution, weighted distribution, z-test calculation, linear regression and multiple regression, analysis of variance, hypothesis testing: t-test and f-test)
*   Document your analysis with Python notebooks and other Python scripts
*   Mine the web for data (particularly social media with existing Python scripts)
*   Get data from APIs and JSON files from the web
*   Do social network analysis with Python
*   Do and publish data visualizations with Python Matplotlib
*   Be confident using the command line and to do quick data analysis with existing tools (options VisData, CSVKit or XSV, Agathe), version controlling and backing up your data with Git and Github.



You will do the above mentioned by:



*   Working with datasets that are valuable to the course reporting theme that apply a particular skill
*   Pair programming, trial and error and peer review
*   Mixing the skills work with reporting
*   Completing short data exercise assignments related to topics and skills learned.

You and your team will produce 2 big stories



*   1 story based on data analysis and reporting.

1 story based in data mining, database building and graphics development.

All the stories will be publish in a class mobile-friendly website with responsive design produced by everyone in the class (we will define roles and responsibilities).

### Plagiarism and Copyright

It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. Plagiarism may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.

In addition to being a serious academic issue, copyright is a serious legal issue.

Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.

Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.

If you're repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you're not sure how to credit code, ask.

The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the [Citizen Media Law Project](http://www.dmlp.org/) is an excellent resource.

When in doubt: ask.
